VSCode Elm plugin v1.4.1 tooling not working for sub probjects. This happens for instance when you have a example folder in a package project.

```
my-package/elm.json
my-package/example/elm.json
```

The tooling does work when you open the sub project seperately. But doesn't work when you change the sub probject code while your in the main project.
